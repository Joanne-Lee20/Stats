                            <li><b>></b> Capable of handling multiple scenarios and search object types, model pre-distress motion and hazards, and account for the affects of previous searches</li>
                            <li><b>></b> Makes requests to and receives from an Environmental Data Server (EDS), which provides both real-time and historical data about the environment</li>
                            <li><b>></b> Also allows manual inputs of winds and currents input via a "sketch" tool using objective analysis techniques</li>
                            <li><b>></b> Projects the drift of the survivors and craft using advanced drift algorithms</li>
                            <li><b>></b> Automates Search Rescue Unit (SRU) allocation by maximizing Probability of Success (POS); each SRU gets a recommended search pattern that accounts for the relative motion between the SRU and the drifting particles (achieved by using the Probability of Detection as function Lateral Range to update the probability of detection for each particle)</li>

                            <li><b>></b> Speech recognition may also be called automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition, or speech-to-text; recognizers utilize natural language processing (NLP) to detect and read human speech, converting it to a written format</li>
                            <li><b>></b> Considered to be one of the most complex areas of computer science, as human language can be difficult to process accurately</li>
                            <li><b>></b> Often incorporated into the systems of mobile devices to facilitate communication through texting or to access virtual agents such as Google Assistant or Apple's Siri to complete tasks such as voice search; Amazon's Alexa or Microsoft's Cortana can be used to play music</li>
                            <li><b>></b> Made up of a few components: speech input, feature extraction, feature vectors, decoder, word output</li>
                            <li><b>></b> Evaluated on accuracy rate, such as speed and word error rate (WER), which can be impacted by factors such as pronunciation, accent, pitch, volume, and background noise</li>
                            <li><b>></b> Improves driver safety by enabling voice-activated navigation systems and search capabilities in car radios</li>
                            <li><b>></b> Used by those in the medical field to capture and log patient diagnoses and treatment notes</li>
